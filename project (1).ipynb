    "In garment creation there are 2 kinds of sizing: straight sizing and fit sizing. When something is straight sized, that means that every size option for a finished piece will have the same proportions, just at different scales. This type of sizing is standard in the fashion industry and the knitting community because it is simplest to write patterns for. However, this sizing does not reflect the actual proportions of a human body. This generator uses fit sizing, but it began as a straight sized pattern I wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "That pattern has 11 sizes and each of those sizes have corresponding finished chest and torso dimensions. For my fit sized pattern, I may mix and match the instructions for a chest circumference of one size with the instructions of a torso length for another. Below are a series of dictionaries which hold the values for each size and their finished measurements. This has been included for easy referencing of the straight size finished measurement values."

    "The function below contains code for 3 main parts: \n",
    "* Calling the functions designed above\n",
    "* The written text of the pattern\n",
    "* the interactive widget\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section calls the functions which were defined in the above code block. Any stitch counts or decrease values (variables which don't make sense as ints) which were not already ints were converted to such at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second section is the largest, and it is the actual text of the pattern set up in a series of print functions. It is an adaptation and an expansion of a pattern I already had written. Typically, when a pattern with multiple sizes reaches a step where the instructions vary across sizes, the text will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bind off 3(4, 5, 6, 7) stitches at the beginning of the next 4 rows*\n",
    "\n",
    "When using that format, the knitter has to remember where in the list the number for their size is. In my generator, every instance where such a list like, the program inserts the knitters individual value which came from their measurements. This was done using formatted string literals. \n",
    "\n",
    "If statements have been inserted into this portion of the code to allow for variation in collar and cuff style.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final section uses the ipywidgets package, and it essentially sets up a user interface within the notebook. It codes for the widget where the knitter inputs their measurements and style preferences into float text boxes and dropdown menus respectively. The text box for chest accepts values from 24 to 67, and the text box for torso accepts values from 16 to 29, both on a 0.1 step. The default values for chest and torso are set to the measurements of the coder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The collar and cuffs dropdown boxes both have the same options: 1x1, Rolled, and Folded. The default for both is 1x1, as that is what I initially wrote in the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "The very end of the block is the Interact Manual statement, which makes the whole function run and generate the pattern upon the user clicking the *Run Interact* button.\n",
